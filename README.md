Dynamic webpage (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap &amp; JS)
Overview of the Analysis
1.	Purpose - The purpose of the exercise is to create a webpage using JavaScript that will present UFO-sighting update to the webpage’s visitors. The users will be able to isolate specific dates these occurrences took place.
2.	See webpage for the results.
3.	Summary
a.	The drawback of the created webpage is connectivity. The code must be able to connect all elements—data, images, chromatic properties, field drop-down menus—to the webpage. If the code drafted by the analyst is imprecise, then users will either receive information for specific UFO-site requests or no information.
b.	The analyst would make two recommendations pertaining to the webpage. The first suggestion involves reviewing the webpage’s creation and maintenance protocols ensuring that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap are, in fact, the most efficient databases. The second recommendation requires invoking a checks-and-balances subprotocol that makes certain the data and images analysts attach to databases are free from malware, trojans, and ransomware.
